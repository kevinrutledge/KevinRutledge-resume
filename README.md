# Kevin Rutledge's Resume

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my professional resume. It's designed to be clean, easy to read, and modifiable for anyone's use.

## Repository Contents

- `KevinRutledge-resume.tex`: The main LaTeX file for the resume.
- `glyphtounicode.tex`: A supplementary LaTeX file to ensure proper encoding of glyphs in the generated PDF.

## How to Use

To compile the resume to a PDF, you will need a LaTeX distribution installed on your system. For example, you can use [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) on Unix/Linux or [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/) on Windows.

### Compilation Steps

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run `pdflatex KevinRutledge-resume.tex` in your terminal or command prompt.

This will generate a PDF version of the resume in the same directory.

## Customization

Feel free to use this template for your own resume. You can modify the `.tex` file as needed to fit your personal information and experiences. Be sure to check and update the `glyphtounicode.tex` file if you're adding new symbols or fonts that are not initially covered.
