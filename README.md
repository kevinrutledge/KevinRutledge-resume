# Kevin Rutledge's Resume

Welcome to the GitHub repository where I host my professional resume. This document is written in LaTeX, a high-quality typesetting system; it includes my educational background, work experience, projects, and technical skills.

## Prerequisites

To compile and view the resume, you will need a LaTeX distribution. For most users, I recommend installing [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) for Linux and Windows, or [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) for macOS. These distributions include the LaTeX base and the necessary compilers and packages.

## Compiling the Resume

After installing a LaTeX distribution, you can compile the resume to a PDF using the following steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kevinrutledge/KevinRutledge-resume.git
   cd KevinRutledge-resume
   ```

2. **Compile the LaTeX Document**:
   * Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```lua
   pdflatex resume.tex
   ```
   * This will generate a **`resume.pdf`** file from the **`resume.tex`** source.

## Viewing the Resume

 Once compiled, the **`resume.pdf`** file can be opened with any standard PDF viewer:

* On Windows: Adobe Reader, Foxit Reader, or Microsoft Edge.
* On macOS: Preview or Adobe Reader.
* On Linux: Evince, Okular, or any other PDF viewer.
